                    <li>The +1.24pp growth shows positive momentum at this critical stage of the funnel, with intent growing faster than consideration.</li>
                    <li>This suggests that while conversion from awareness to consideration is challenging, those who do consider Abu Dhabi are increasingly likely to convert to actual intent.</li>
                    <li>Marketing should focus on creating urgency and addressing practical barriers to booking (visa process, flight availability, etc.).</li>

                    <li>This is significant enough to warrant highly seasonal marketing strategies with concentrated efforts during peak periods.</li>
                    <li>Marketing efforts should be heavily concentrated before peak periods (considering the 69-day booking window).</li>
                    <li>There's also opportunity to grow travel interest during off-peak months through targeted campaigns.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 0.38 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 3.8%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and moderate (less than 1.0 but greater than 0.3).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI with reasonable efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce meaningful growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate elasticity suggests that the USA market is reasonably responsive to media campaigns, but other factors also significantly influence travel interest.</li>

                <p>Develop premium travel packages for the US market that combine stays at top-searched luxury properties with experiences at nearby attractions. For example, create an "Ultimate Yas Island Experience" package featuring W Abu Dhabi or Hilton Abu Dhabi with Ferrari World and SeaWorld access. Similarly, develop a "Cultural Luxury" package combining Emirates Palace stays with guided tours of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and Qasr Al Watan. These packages should be promoted through US travel agents and online platforms with a 90-120 day advance booking window to align with US travelers' planning behavior.</p>
